	Obstacles :

Oct 26, 2017
	Yesterday :n/as
	Today     :Work on replacing text in buttons with icons representing various shapes. 
	Obstacles :Adding icons in buttons is a new concept uncovered in course material. Additional research is expected. 

Oct 27, 2017
	Yesterday :Could add icons but ran into difficulty with selecting them through relative class path. 
	Today     :Try to work on icon feature, if possible. However, 207 test may take up too much time for me to 
			work properly.
	Obstacles :n/a

Oct 28, 2017
	Yesterday :Couldn't do much work because of 207 test preparation.
	Today     :Add icons to buttons using relative class path, so feature is visible from other computers as well. 
	Obstacles :Figuring out how to implement relative class path. 

Oct 29, 2017
	Yesterday : Solved issue of locating icon image files through relative class path. Completed Bug1.
	Today     : Aim to complete Bug2. Indiciate drawing mode selected through disabling that button. 
	Obstacles : n/a

Oct 30, 2017
	Yesterday : Completed Bug2 and merged with master branch. Committed them to origin. Created new Branch for UserStory5.
	Today     : Aim to complete UserStory5. Create way of selecting color through buttons. 
	Obstacles : Working through the concept of selecting colors for drawings.

Oct 31, 2017
	Yesterday : Completed partially UserStory5, including creating buttons for colors.
	Today     : Further implement features needed for color selector, and aim to finish. 
	Obstacles : n/a

Nov 1, 2017
	Yesterday :Ran into unexpected obstancle of distinguishing button where action was performed.
	Today     :Aim to figure out the bug that occured from solving Bug#1 and aim to finish UserStory5.
	Obstacles :figuring out how to distinguish button when their getActionCommand() method doesn't apply anymore due to having images instead of text.
	
Nov 2, 2017
	Yesterday :Solved bug that occured later from finishing user story Bug#1. Created a proper user friendly color selector interface.
	Today     :Realized more color options are necessary. Reconsider color selector implementation and explore different, perhaps more user friendly and effective interface.
	Obstacles :Choosing which implementation works best may need some time.
	
Nov 3, 2017
	Yesterday : Decided that going with current JComboBox implementation, but with smaller, but more various color images, is best. 
	Today     :Edit all color images to make at least 20 variations for spectrum effect and make them smaller. 
	Obstacles :Reading image files from a hashmap will have definite hiccups. 

Nov 4, 2017
	Yesterday :Created around 20 different color images with dimensions 200x30 to fit into JComboBox. 
	Today     :Finalize ColorSelector and make sure all features are running as intended. 
	Obstacles :Implementing hsmap.ser as LinkedHashMap data structure. 

Nov 5, 2017
	Yesterday :Almost finalized, but still had a bug with the previous drawn shapes' color changing as well when new color was chosen.
	Today     :Finish ColorSelector and finish documentation and smoothen out any bugs, along with changing method of constructing icons in panels.
	Obstacles :Fixing bug of maintaing previously drawn shape's colors when new color's chosen. 

Nov 9, 2017
	Yesterday :n/a
	Today     :Create and select user stories, including U.S. 2.2 and 2.3 and add them to sprint backlog. 
	Obstacles :None expected. 

Nov 10, 2017
	Yesterday :Took care of all user story related tasks and set path to complete them, including making a 
			new branch for U.S. 2.2. 
	Today     :Start working on creating the structure for completing a blank canvas functionality.
	Obstacles :The dynamics of working around the graphic component of Java may come as a challenge. 

Nov 11, 2017
	Yesterday :Did extensive research on the grphic component, especially in regards to the method paintComponent() and decided 
			that a separate panel for the user to make use of blank canvas feature. 
	Today     :Create a separate panel class for the user to interact with. 
	Obstacles :None expected. 

Nov 12, 2017
	Yesterday :Created a separate panel class, named EraserPanel.
	Today     :Continue implementing on EraserPanel, until deliverable is visible.
	Obstacles :None expected.

Nov 13, 2017
	Yesterday :Continued implementing on EraserPanel.
	Today     :Try to finish EraserPanel by today.
	Obstacles :Implementing while taking into consideration an effective design pattern may present itself as a challenge.

Nov 14, 2017
	Yesterday :Realized that the JMenuBar implementation would be more user friendly. Hence, decided to re-do my previous work.
	Today     :Finish blank canvas feature today and aim to complete inverting images to negative feature as well. 
			Also, add any additional new user stories deemed possible, such as save or exit feature.
	Obstacles :The code implementation for inverting images to negative may be a challenge as it dives deep into graphical context.
